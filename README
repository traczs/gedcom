CODE KNOWN ISSUES:
-Families gets pointed to the last family created and overwrites all the previous ones to the last one.
 I had the same problem with individuals.
 To fix this I should malloc in a smaller scope, but that seg faults so I cried instead.
- Individuals probably don't have a family list 
- Header might not have the submitter pointer
- I assume individuals are before families in the gedcom and havent tested the other way but I'm sure that would break my program.
- Printing out the gedcom: I printed out header, submitter, list of individuals and "list of families"(the same last familiy over and over).
- the functions that return char* need to be free'd in main so I don't know what to do about that
- getDescendants will maybe print out the kids but nothing more.
